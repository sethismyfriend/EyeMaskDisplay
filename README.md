# EyeMaskDisplay

Files here are from a test application written in swift to control 2 APA-102 matrix strips from Adafruit in a sleepmask. 

The application allows you to paint different colors into each mask and upload the colors to each eye. 

Arduino code takes the commands over bluetooth and assigns colors to the LEDs.
